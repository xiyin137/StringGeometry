# Composition of Formal Power Series

This file develops the theory of composition for formal power series,
following Propositions 7.15 and 7.16 from the Waterloo C&O 430 notes.

## When is Composition Well-Defined?

Given f(x) = Σ aₙxⁿ and g(x) = Σ bⱼxʲ, the composition f(g(x)) is defined as
  f(g(x)) := Σₙ aₙ g(x)ⁿ = lim_{K→∞} Σₙ₌ᵢ₍ₖ₎^K aₙ g(x)ⁿ

**Proposition 7.15**: f(g(x)) is well-defined iff one of:
  (i)   g(x) = 0 and I(f) ≥ 0
  (ii)  g(x) ≠ 0 and f(x) has finitely many nonzero coefficients (i.e., f is polynomial)
  (iii) g(x) ≠ 0 and I(g) > 0 (g has no constant term)

The key insight: when I(g) > 0, each coefficient of the composition receives
contributions from only finitely many terms, making the limit well-defined.

/-! ### Condition for Composition -/

/-- Condition for composition to be well-defined: g has positive index (no constant term).
    This is condition (iii) of Proposition 7.15. -/
def CompositionWellDefined (g : R⟦X⟧) : Prop :=
  constantCoeff g = 0

theorem X_composition_well_defined : CompositionWellDefined (X : R⟦X⟧) :=
  constantCoeff_X

/-- When g has no constant term, the n-th coefficient of g^k is zero for k > n.
    This is why composition is well-defined when I(g) > 0. -/
