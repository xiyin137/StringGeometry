# Logarithmic and Exponential Series

This file develops the theory of logarithmic and exponential formal power series,
following Example 7.9 and Exercise 12 from the Waterloo C&O 430 notes.

## Main Definitions

### Logarithmic Series (Example 7.9a)
  log(1/(1-x)) = Σₙ₌₁^∞ xⁿ/n
  log(1-x) = -Σₙ₌₁^∞ xⁿ/n

### Exponential Series (Example 7.9b)
  exp(x) = Σₙ₌₀^∞ xⁿ/n!

## Main Theorems

**Key Identity (Exercise 12d from Waterloo notes)**:
  exp(log(1/(1-x))) = 1/(1-x)
  Equivalently: exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x

The coefficients of exp(log(1-x)) are exactly (1, -1, 0, 0, ...).

## Application to Nilpotent Elements

For a nilpotent element x with x^{N+1} = 0:
- log(1-x) = -x - x²/2 - ⋯ - x^N/N (finite sum)
- exp(L) = 1 + L + L²/2! + ⋯ (truncates)
- exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x

For the differential equation approach to exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x, we need formal derivatives.

/-! ### The ODE and Coefficient Recurrence

The differential equation approach shows that f = exp(L) satisfies
  f' · (1-x) = -f  with  f(0) = 1

This ODE implies the coefficient recurrence (k+1)·a_{k+1} = (k-1)·a_k.

The key identity is:
  D(exp(L)) · (1-x) = exp(L) · D(L) · (1-x) = exp(L) · (-1) = -exp(L)

where we use derivLog_mul_one_sub to get D(L) · (1-x) = -1. -/

/-- The key ODE: exp(L) · derivLog · (1-x) = -exp(L).
    This follows directly from derivLog_mul_one_sub. -/

    -expNilpotent (logOneSubNilpotent x N) N := by
  rw [mul_assoc, derivLog_mul_one_sub x N hx, mul_neg_one]

/-! ### The ODE Characterization

The key to proving exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x is that both sides satisfy
the same ODE: f' · (1-x) = -f with f(0) = 1.

Writing f = ∑ aₖ xᵏ, the ODE gives the recurrence:
  (k+1)·a_{k+1} = (k-1)·aₖ

Combined with a₀ = 1, the uniqueness theorem `expLogCoeff_unique`
shows aₖ = expLogCoeff(k), hence f = 1 - x. -/

/-! ### The Key Proof: exp(-L) = geometric series

The proof uses the duality:
- L = log(1-x) = -∑ x^k/k
- -L = ∑ x^k/k = log(1/(1-x))
- exp(-L) = 1/(1-x) = ∑ x^k (geometric series)
- exp(L) · exp(-L) = 1, so exp(L) = 1 - x -/

/-- The negation of logOneSubNilpotent gives the log of 1/(1-x). -/
theorem neg_logOneSubNilpotent_eq (x : R) (N : ℕ) :
    -logOneSubNilpotent x N = ∑ k ∈ range N, algebraMap ℚ R (1 / (k + 1 : ℕ)) * x ^ (k + 1) := by
  unfold logOneSubNilpotent
  simp only [neg_neg]

/-- exp(-L) equals the geometric series ∑ x^k.
    This follows from the ODE: let f = exp(g)·(1-x) where g = -L.
    Then f' = exp(g)·g'·(1-x) - exp(g) = exp(g)·(g'·(1-x) - 1) = 0 since g'·(1-x) = 1.
    With f(0) = 1, we get f = 1, i.e., exp(-L)·(1-x) = 1. -/
theorem expNilpotent_neg_log_eq_geom (x : R) (N : ℕ) (hN : 1 ≤ N) (hx : x ^ (N + 1) = 0) :
    expNilpotent (-logOneSubNilpotent x N) (N + 1) = ∑ k ∈ range (N + 1), x ^ k := by
  /-
  This is the standard FPS identity: exp(log(1/(1-x))) = 1/(1-x) = ∑ x^k.

  Writing -L = xP where P = 1 + x/2 + x²/3 + ..., we have:
    exp(xP) = ∑_j (1/j!) x^j P^j

  The coefficient of x^k in exp(xP) is:
    [x^k] exp(xP) = ∑_{j=0}^k (1/j!) [x^{k-j}] P^j

  This equals 1 for all k, giving exp(xP) = ∑ x^k.

  Verification for small k:
    k=0: 1 ✓
    k=1: 0 + [x^0]P = 1 ✓
    k=2: 0 + [x^1]P + (1/2)[x^0]P² = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 ✓
    k=3: 0 + [x^2]P + (1/2)[x^1]P² + (1/6)[x^0]P³ = 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/6 = 1 ✓

  The general identity follows from the generating function structure.

  **Differential Equation Proof:**

  The key insight is that logOneSubNilpotent x N = logOneSubNilpotent x (N+1) when x^{N+1} = 0,
  because the extra term x^{N+1}/(N+1) vanishes.

  Using the extended bound N+1:
  - derivLogOneSubNilpotent x (N+1) = -(1 + x + ... + x^N)
  - derivLogOneSubNilpotent x (N+1) · (1-x) = -1 (by derivLog_mul_one_sub with x^{N+1} = 0)

  For -L = -logOneSubNilpotent x N:
  - deriv(-L) = -derivL = (1 + x + ... + x^N)
  - deriv(-L) · (1-x) = 1

  The ODE for h = exp(-L) · (1-x):
  - h' = exp(-L) · deriv(-L) · (1-x) - exp(-L) = exp(-L) · (1 - 1) = 0
  - h(0) = exp(0) · 1 = 1
  - Therefore h = 1, i.e., exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1.

  -- Since (∑ x^k) · (1-x) = 1 (by hgeom), and exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1 (by ODE),
  -- both exp(-L) and ∑ x^k are the unique inverse of (1-x), hence equal.

  -- Key insight: use exp(L) · exp(-L) = 1 together with the main theorem approach.

  -- Therefore exp(-L) = ∑ x^k (both have product 1 with exp(L)).

  -- However, this uses the main theorem which we're trying to prove!
  -- The non-circular proof requires the coefficient identity directly.

  -- Alternative: Show exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1 by direct polynomial expansion.
  -- exp(-L) = 1 + (-L) + (-L)²/2! + ... where -L = x + x²/2 + ... + x^N/N
  -- Since -L = x·P with P = 1 + x/2 + ..., we have (-L)^j = x^j · P^j.
  -- The coefficient of x^k in exp(-L) is ∑_{j=0}^k (1/j!) · [x^{k-j}]P^j = 1.
  -- This follows from the generating function identity for exp(log(1/(1-x))) = 1/(1-x).

  -- For the Lean proof, we use the fact that both exp(-L) and ∑x^k satisfy:
  -- 1. f · (1-x) = 1
  -- 2. These are the unique such f (since (1-x) is a unit with unique inverse)
  -- Therefore exp(-L) = ∑ x^k.

  -- From hgeom: (∑ x^k) is the inverse of (1-x).
  -- We need to show exp(-L) is also the inverse of (1-x).
  -- That is: exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1 AND (1-x) · exp(-L) = 1.
  -- In a commutative ring, these are equivalent.

  -- The product exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1 follows from the coefficient identity:
  -- [x^k](exp(-L) · (1-x)) = [x^k]exp(-L) - [x^{k-1}]exp(-L) = 1 - 1 = 0 for k ≥ 1
  -- [x^0](exp(-L) · (1-x)) = [x^0]exp(-L) = 1
  -- Hence exp(-L) · (1-x) = 1.

  -- Since (∑ x^k) is the unique inverse of (1-x), exp(-L) = ∑ x^k.
  -- The uniqueness follows from: if f · (1-x) = 1 = g · (1-x), then f = g
  -- (multiply both by (1-x)^{-1} = ∑ x^k on the right).

  -- Formal proof: show exp(-L) = ∑ x^k by showing they have the same product with (1-x).

/-! ### The Key Identity: exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x

The identity exp(log(1/(1-x))) = 1/(1-x), equivalently exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x,
is Exercise 12(d) from the Waterloo C&O 430 notes (page 14).

**Proof Approach** (from Exercises 12a-c):

1. For f(x) with [x⁰]f(x) = 1, define log(f(x)) via integration of f'(x)/f(x)
2. Show d/dx[log(f(x))] = f⁻¹(x) · f'(x) (Exercise 12b)
3. Show log(exp(x)) = x by differentiation (Exercise 12c)
4. For g(x) = log(1/(1-x)) = Σ xⁿ/n, show exp(g(x)) = 1/(1-x) by:
   - Let h(x) = exp(g(x)) · (1-x)
   - h'(x) = exp(g(x))·g'(x)·(1-x) + exp(g(x))·(-1) = exp(g(x))·[1/(1-x)·(1-x) - 1] = 0
   - So h(x) is constant, and h(0) = exp(0)·1 = 1
   - Therefore exp(g(x))·(1-x) = 1, i.e., exp(g(x)) = 1/(1-x)

For nilpotent elements, the infinite series truncate to finite sums,
and the polynomial identity exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x holds.

The coefficients of exp(log(1-x)) are exactly (1, -1, 0, 0, ...),
captured by `expLogCoeff`, which gives the result.

**General Proof Strategy**:

The key insight is that exp(log(1-x)) = ∑ expLogCoeff(k) x^k = 1 - x.
This follows from:
1. The coefficients of exp(log(1-x)) satisfy the recurrence (from differential equation)
2. By `expLogCoeff_unique`, they equal expLogCoeff
3. By `expLogCoeff_sum_eq_one_sub`, the sum is 1 - x

The proof uses the factored form L = -xQ where Q = 1 + x/2 + x²/3 + ...,
giving L^j = (-1)^j x^j Q^j. The coefficient of x^k in exp(L) is then
∑_{j≤k} (1/j!) (-1)^j [x^{k-j} in Q^j], which equals expLogCoeff(k) by
the Faà di Bruno formula / coefficient cancellation.
-/

/-- The main identity: exp(log(1-x)) = 1 - x for nilpotent x.

    This is Exercise 12d from the Waterloo C&O 430 notes.

    **Proof outline** (from the differential equation):
    Let f = exp(log(1-x)). Then f' = f · (log(1-x))' = f · (-1/(1-x)).
    So f' · (1-x) = -f, giving f' - xf' = -f.

    Writing f = ∑ aₖ xᵏ and equating coefficients of xⁿ⁻¹:
    n·aₙ - (n-1)·aₙ₋₁ = -aₙ₋₁
    ⟹ n·aₙ = (n-2)·aₙ₋₁
    ⟹ aₙ = ((n-2)/n)·aₙ₋₁

    With a₀ = 1 (from f(0) = exp(0) = 1):
    - a₁ = (-1/1)·a₀ = -1
    - a₂ = (0/2)·a₁ = 0
    - aₖ = 0 for all k ≥ 2 (by induction)

    Therefore f = a₀ + a₁·x = 1 - x.

    The coefficients (1, -1, 0, 0, ...) are exactly `expLogCoeff`, and
    `expLogCoeff_sum_eq_one_sub` shows their sum equals 1 - x. -/

  **Proof Strategy (Differential Equation Approach)**

  The identity exp(log(1-x)) = 1-x is Exercise 12d from the Waterloo C&O 430 notes.

  Let f = exp(log(1-x)) = exp(L) where L = log(1-x) = -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - ...
  Then f satisfies the ODE: f' · (1-x) = -f with f(0) = 1.

  Writing f = ∑ aₖ xᵏ and equating coefficients:
  - From f' = ∑ k·aₖ xᵏ⁻¹ and the equation f'·(1-x) = -f:
  - Coefficient of xⁿ⁻¹: n·aₙ - (n-1)·aₙ₋₁ = -aₙ₋₁
  - This gives: n·aₙ = (n-2)·aₙ₋₁, i.e., (n+1)·aₙ₊₁ = (n-1)·aₙ

  With a₀ = f(0) = exp(0) = 1, the sequence (aₙ) satisfies the recurrence
  (k+1)·a_{k+1} = (k-1)·aₖ with a₀ = 1.

  By `expLogCoeff_unique`, this sequence equals `expLogCoeff`.
  By `expLogCoeff_sum_eq_one_sub`, ∑ expLogCoeff(k) · xᵏ = 1 - x.

  For the nilpotent case, both sides are finite polynomials in x,
  and the formal identity specializes to give the result.

  rw [← hsum]

  -- The coefficient of x^k in exp(L) equals expLogCoeff(k) by the recurrence argument.
  -- This is a formal power series identity that holds when truncated for nilpotent x.

  -- For the nilpotent case, we verify this directly using the definitions.
  -- exp(L) = ∑_j (1/j!) L^j where L = -xQ with Q = 1 + x/2 + x²/3 + ...
  -- L^j = (-1)^j x^j Q^j, so the coefficient of x^k in exp(L) is
  -- ∑_{j≤k} (1/j!) (-1)^j [x^{k-j} in Q^j]

  -- PROOF STRATEGY (Differential Equation Approach):
  --
  -- 1. exp(L) satisfies the ODE: f · D(L) · (1-x) = -f (proven in exp_derivLog_one_sub)
  --    where D(L) = derivLogOneSubNilpotent is the formal derivative of L.
  --
  -- 2. The ODE f' · (1-x) = -f with f(0) = 1 has a unique solution:
  --    The coefficient recurrence (k+1)·a_{k+1} = (k-1)·a_k with a_0 = 1
  --    uniquely determines a_k = expLogCoeff(k) by expLogCoeff_unique.
  --
  -- 3. Since 1-x also satisfies the ODE (as D(1-x) = -1, so D(1-x)·(1-x) = -(1-x))
  --    and has constant term 1, both exp(L) and (1-x) are the unique solution.
  --
  -- 4. Therefore exp(L) = 1-x.
  --
  -- The key insight is that the chain rule D(exp(L)) = exp(L)·D(L) holds for
  -- polynomial expressions in nilpotent x, so the ODE for exp(L) follows from
  -- the identity D(L)·(1-x) = -1 (derivLog_mul_one_sub).

  -- We prove this by showing both sides equal as polynomials in x.
  -- The coefficient of x^k in exp(L) equals expLogCoeff(k) by the ODE argument.

  -- First, verify the constant term matches: exp(L) at x=0 equals 1 = expLogCoeff(0).
  -- Then, use the coefficient recurrence to show all coefficients match expLogCoeff.

  -- The proof uses the differential equation characterization.
  -- Both exp(L) and (1-x) satisfy the ODE: f' · (1-x) = -f with f(0) = 1.
  -- The ODE implies the coefficient recurrence (k+1)·a_{k+1} = (k-1)·a_k.
  -- By expLogCoeff_unique, this recurrence with a₀ = 1 uniquely gives expLogCoeff.
  -- Therefore exp(L) = ∑ expLogCoeff(k) x^k = 1 - x.

  -- The formal proof requires:
  -- 1. Chain rule: D(exp(L)) = exp(L) · D(L) for polynomial expressions in nilpotent x
  -- 2. ODE identity: D(L) · (1-x) = -1 (this is derivLog_mul_one_sub)
