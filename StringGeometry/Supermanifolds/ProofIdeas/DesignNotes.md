## Key Distinction: Fermionic Coordinates vs Grassmann Algebra Coefficients

### The Local Model ℝ^{p|q}

For a super domain ℝ^{p|q}, there are **q fermionic coordinates** θ₁,...,θq.
The structure sheaf assigns to each open U ⊆ ℝ^p:

```
O(U) = C^∞(U, ℝ) ⊗_ℝ ∧(ℝ^q)
```

Sections have the form:
```
f(x,θ) = Σ_I f_I(x) θ^I
```
where:
- I ranges over subsets of {1,...,q}
- f_I : U → ℝ are smooth **ℝ-valued** coefficient functions
- θ^I = θ^{i₁} ∧ ... ∧ θ^{i_k} for I = {i₁ < ... < i_k}

**In the local model, coefficients are in ℝ**, not in a Grassmann algebra.

### Transition Maps and Grassmann Algebra Coefficients

When gluing local models to form a supermanifold, transition maps
```
φ_αβ : U_α ∩ U_β → ℝ^{p|q}
```
have the form:
```
x'_i = f^i_0(x) + θ^j f^i_j(x) + θ^j θ^k f^i_{jk}(x) + ...
θ'_s = ψ^s_j(x) θ^j + ψ^s_{jk}(x) θ^j θ^k + ...
```

For a **single supermanifold** (not a family):
- The coefficients f^i_I, ψ^s_I are still ℝ-valued

For **families of supermanifolds** (e.g., parameterized by odd moduli η₁,...,η_s):
- The coefficients can be **Grassmann algebra-valued** (involving η's)
- This is essential for super Riemann surfaces and supermoduli spaces

### Super Riemann Surfaces

As noted in Witten's "Notes On Supermanifolds And Integration" (arXiv:1209.2199):

> "Though M depends on η₁...ηs, it does not have a reduced space that depends on
> those parameters. The reason is that since the gluing functions ψ^i_αβ can depend
> on the η's, we will in general get gluing laws such as θ_α = θ_β + η and we cannot
> consistently set the θ's to zero unless we also set the η's to zero."

This is why:
- Supermoduli space of super Riemann surfaces involves Grassmann-valued transition maps
- There is no elementary map from supermoduli space to ordinary moduli space
- The Grassmann algebra for coefficients is **separate** from the fermionic coordinates

### Summary

| Context | Fermionic coords | Coefficient algebra |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Local model ℝ^{p|q} | θ₁,...,θq | ℝ |
| Single supermanifold | θ₁,...,θq | ℝ |
| Family of supermanifolds | θ₁,...,θq | Grassmann algebra (involving η's) |
| Supermoduli space | θ₁,...,θq (on fibers) | Full Grassmann algebra |

## Grassmann Algebra Matrix Warning

**Be careful when manipulating matrices over Grassmann algebra!**

Some properties of matrices over a field do **NOT** apply to matrices over a (super)commutative ring:

1. **Determinant multiplicativity**: `Matrix.det_mul` requires `CommRing` - OK for Grassmann algebra
2. **Invertibility criteria**: A matrix over Grassmann algebra may not have a standard inverse even if its body has nonzero determinant
3. **Eigenvalue decomposition**: Does not generally apply
4. **Rank-nullity**: More subtle over non-fields
5. **Berezinian**: Requires special invertibility conditions (D block must be invertible)

**Key distinction**:
- `body_jacobian_cocycle`: Works over ℝ - standard `Matrix.det_mul` applies
- `berezinian_cocycle_full`: Works over Grassmann algebra - requires `SuperMatrix.ber_mul` (which needs additional hypotheses)

When proving cocycle conditions:
- For body maps: Use `Matrix.det_mul` directly (matrices over ℝ)
- For full Berezinian: Need `SuperMatrix.ber_mul` with invertibility hypotheses

See Deligne-Morgan "Notes on Supersymmetry" for rigorous treatment of supermatrices.

## Grassmann Algebra: Commutative Ring, NOT a Field

**Critical distinction**: The even part of the Grassmann algebra Λ_q is a **commutative ring** with
**zero divisors**, NOT a field. This has several important consequences:

### Zero Divisors
- Example in Λ₂: θ₁θ₂ · θ₁θ₂ = 0, but θ₁θ₂ ≠ 0
- Even elements like θ₁θ₂ ∈ Λ₂^even can be zero divisors
- Products of soul elements can vanish even when neither factor is zero

### Division is Not Available
- `FiniteGrassmannCarrier q` has no `Field` instance
- NEVER use `(x : FiniteGrassmannCarrier q)⁻¹` or division within the Grassmann algebra
- Taylor coefficients 1/n! must be **ℝ-scalar multiplication**: `((n.factorial : ℝ)⁻¹) • (...)`
- The `FPSLogExp` infrastructure handles this correctly via `Algebra ℚ R` (rational scalar action)

### Invertibility Requires Nonzero Body
- An element `a ∈ FiniteGrassmannCarrier q` is invertible iff `grassmannBody a ≠ 0`
- The inverse is constructed via: `a⁻¹ = (body a)⁻¹ · (1 + (body a)⁻¹ · soul a)⁻¹`
- The second factor uses the geometric series `(1 + ε)⁻¹ = Σ (-ε)^n` (terminates by nilpotency)
- This is analogous to `FPSBasic.invertible_iff_constantTerm_invertible` for formal power series

### Berezinian Invertibility
- The Berezinian `Ber(J_φ) = det(A - BD⁻¹C) / det(D)` requires:
  - `det(D)` has **nonzero body** (essential hypothesis, NOT automatic)
  - `det(A - BD⁻¹C)` has **nonzero body** (for the overall Berezinian to be defined)
- These are carried as explicit hypotheses in `SuperJacobian.berezinianAt`

### Implications for Taylor Expansion
- The nilpotent Taylor expansion `f(a + δ) = Σ (1/n!) D^n f(a) · δ^n` uses:
  - Derivatives `D^n f(a)` evaluated at **real** points → produces ℝ values
  - Products `δ_{k₁} · ... · δ_{k_n}` computed in the Grassmann **ring** (not field)
  - Scalar multiplication `(1/n! : ℝ) • (product)` to combine
- The sum truncates at order q because products of q+1 or more soul elements vanish
  (by `grassmann_soul_nilpotent` / `hasNoConstant` argument)
- When δ_k come from **even** coordinate functions, they commute → multinomial formula applies
- When δ_k are general Grassmann elements, ordering in the product matters

### Connection to Existing FPS Infrastructure
- `FPSLogExp.expNilpotent` uses `(k.factorial : ℚ)⁻¹ • L^k` — correct ℚ-scalar multiplication
- `FPSLogExp.logOneSubNilpotent` uses `algebraMap ℚ R (1/(k+1)) * x^(k+1)` — correct rational coefficients
- Both work over `CommRing R` with `Algebra ℚ R`, applicable to even Grassmann subalgebra
- For the full Grassmann algebra (not commutative), these results apply to even elements only
